## Project Description

**text_to_json** is a Python-based tool that processes plain text from a file and converts it into a structured JSON format. This project is ideal for data extraction tasks where the input consists of semi-structured information that needs to be organized for analysis or further use.

Clarification:

The provided code not only converts plain text into a structured JSON format, but also performs additional data processing. Specifically, it:

Adds an ID to each club entry, starting from a specified ID (start_id), ensuring each item is uniquely identifiable.
Includes an empty "img" field for each club, which can later be populated with images as needed.
Fixes the "web" field by ensuring the URL starts with "https://", adding the prefix if necessary for proper formatting

## Key Features

- **Plain Text Processing:** Extracts key information from a text file (`input_text.txt`).
- **JSON Conversion:** Structures the extracted data into a JSON file for easy manipulation.
- **Easy Customization:** Modular code to adjust regular expressions based on the input format.
- **Simple Automation:** Designed to simplify repetitive data extraction tasks.

## Technologies and Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python 3.8+
- **Key Libraries:**
  - re (Regular Expressions)
  - json (JSON Manipulation)
- **Development Environment:** Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
- **Package Manager:** pip

## Setup and Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/laylop/text_to_json.git
cd text_to_json
Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
bash
Copiar código
python -m venv venv
Windows:
bash
Copiar código
venv\Scripts\activate
macOS/Linux:
bash
Copiar código
source venv/bin/activate
Install Dependencies (if any)
bash
Copiar código
pip install -r requirements.txt
Prepare the Input File
Ensure the file input_text.txt is in the same directory as the script main.py and follows the expected format.

Run the Project

bash
Copiar código
python main.py
The generated JSON file will be available in the output/ folder as text.json.

Upload the Project to GitHub
Create a remote repository on GitHub named text_to_json.
From the local project folder, execute the following commands:
bash
Copiar código
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/laylop/text_to_json.git
git add .
git commit -m "Initialize text_to_json project"
git push -u origin master
Potential Improvements
Support for Additional Formats: Extend functionality to accept CSV or XML files as input.
User Interface (UI): Create a graphical interface to load the text file and view the results.
Input Validation: Add checks to ensure the input text format is correct.
API Integration: Export directly to cloud services like Firebase or AWS S3.
